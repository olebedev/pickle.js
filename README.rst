Pickle.js is a JavaScript implementation of the Python pickle format.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It supports pickles containing a cross-language subset of the primitive types.

Fokred from Frank Salim's `google code <http://code.google.com/p/pickle-js/>`_ repo.
For what? To added support for ``LONG`` and ``UNICODE`` data type.
